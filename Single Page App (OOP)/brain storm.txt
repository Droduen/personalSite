I want to create a fire-boy & water-girl type of game where two players operate separate players and work together to solve puzzles. I want to have collectables, hazards, rare collectables and more possibly.


 - Make floor objects, wall objects, and two playable character objects!!


NExt objective:

 - Make firelad moveable and can jump, and gravity is interruptable on impact with a floor. Define floors! Define walls! Define ceil!

- Overall make a player that can move left to right and can jump and only stops falling from jump on impact with a defined floor!S
